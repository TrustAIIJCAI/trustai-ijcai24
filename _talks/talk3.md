Ensuring trustworthy machine learning (ML) is crucial as ML applications impact our daily lives in sensitive areas like healthcare, medical decision-making, and hiring. Although individuals are ultimately affected by model decisions, trustworthiness is usually viewed from the model's perspective, focusing on, e.g. “model robustness” and “privacy levels of the model”. Little thought is given to the individual level, such as considering whether the privacy level of the model actually aligns with the specific privacy desires of those whose data is used for training that model. My research challenges this approach by considering ML from the individual's perspective. This includes, among others, developing methods that ensure individual-level privacy protection of varying strengths for each data point, depending on their requirements, characterizing individual privacy risks for individuals, and evaluating the impact of individualized privacy on other trustworthiness aspects. Through this, I aim to create trustworthy ML systems from diverse individuals for diverse individuals.
